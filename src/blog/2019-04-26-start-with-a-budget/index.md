Good companies with good projects all have budgets. This remains true whether it's a Target Wharehouse project or a "Uncle Moe's Pie Shop" online ordering project.

Clients often ask me, "how much will this project cost?". I often counter with "well, what is your budget?". This is not to take advantage of them. I am not thinking "I hope they say $60k because I think it's going to cost $30k". This is hard to convey because this sort of question gets asked when we least know or trust one another. I can see how this can come off as snakle oil salesman-y.

I am not asking for a budget because I am trying to take advantage. I need to understand the budget so I can give immediate feedback on whether the project is doable, if it will be tight, or if there is plenty in the budget. If you want to an online ordering system and you have a $5,000 budget, we are going to have to get crafty..and it will most likely not require any code. If you have $300,000 budget, we will most likely be able to implement your vision and there will be some left over or you will have a killer admin feature.

If we start with a budget instead of scope, we will immediately start talking about real things. We will not be estimating push notifications if your budget does not call for that. If we only talk about scope, that feature may make it's way into our discussions but that will be a waste of time and energy for both of us.
